The file **x_final_tidy_set.txt** contains the final tidy set. There is one observation per line and one variable per column.

  * First column - **subject** gives the id of the subject who took part in the experiment
  * Second column - **activity** gives the name of the activity which the subject performed
  * Rest of the columns - different indicators related to the activity performed by the subject. Details about these can be found in the original **features.txt** file. 
    Feature meaning didn't change because of the analysis performed. Important to note here is that the values of the features are the mean of the subject per activity.
